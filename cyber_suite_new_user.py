# BRIEF DESCRIPTION:  A program to make a new user



# 1. Make sure you fill out the comments above
# 2. Write your code in the proper spot
# 3. Be sure to answer the Reflection Questions below
# 4. The Sample Output has been included in this code for your convenience


# HINT: Tackle this one step at a time. First, just ask the name and the ID number
#       and then print those out. Once you get that working, add in the password.
#
#       Think about how to get the length of the password
#       Then, think about how to print out the Xs. Perhaps you can use string multiplication?

    password = input( "Please enter your password: \n")

    print(f'Welcome {name}. Your ID is {user_id}.\n')

    hidden_password = "X" * len(password)
    
    print(f'PASSWORD: \n{hidden_password}')

1. This project has a bit of a speed bump (converting the password to XXXXs). What was your thought process?


My first thought was to use character multiplication. However, to do so, I needed to know the length of the input password each time it was entered. I ran a quick search and found the len( ) method on geeks for geeks and worked with that. It took me a few to times to put it together correctly but I eventually got it.
